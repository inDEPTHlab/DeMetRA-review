Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes have identifiable patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) change: DNAm signatures or episignatures. Given the role of KANSL1 in histone acetylation, we tested whether variants underlying KdVS are associated with a DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 13 individuals with KANSL1 variants, four individuals with 17q21.31 microdeletions, and 21 typically developing individuals, using Illumina’s Infinium EPIC array. In this study, we identified a robust DNAm signature of 456 significant CpG sites in 8 individuals with KdVS, a pattern independently validated in an additional 7 individuals with KdVS. We also demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the signature and classify two KANSL1 VUS as well as four variants in individuals with atypical clinical presentation. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific DNAm changes in fibroblast cells from individuals with KdVS. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the epigenetic landscape related to KdVS and aid in the diagnosis and classification of variants in this structurally complex genomic region.","['Awamleh, Z.', 'Choufani, S.', 'Wu, W.', 'Rots, D.', 'Dingemans, A.

Psychosocial adversity in pregnancy may influence GEA, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. DNA methylation to glucocorticoid regulation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes are implicated but have not been fully examined in association with GEA. This study investigated whether a polyepigenetic glucocorticoid exposure score (PGES) and HPA axis gene (NR3C1, HSD11B2, FKBP5) methylation were associated with GEA, and whether associations were sex-specific. Participants were from a prospective cohort of racial/ethnic diverse and socially disadvantaged pregnant women and infants (n = 200). DNA methylation variables were estimated using umbilical cord blood. PGES was derived with CpGs shown to be sensitive to synthetic dexamethasone exposure. NR3C1, HSD11B2, and FKBP5 methylation was summarized via factor analysis. We found that PGES (beta = -1.12, SE = 0.47, p = 0.02) and several NR3C1 and FKBP5 factor scores were associated with decelerated GEA (all p < 0.05). A significant sex interaction was observed for FKBP5 factor score 3 (beta = -0.34, SE = 0.15, p = 0.02) suggesting decelerated GEA for males but not females. This study showed that glucocorticoid regulation-related DNA methylation was associated with a decelerated aging phenotype at birth that might indicate a neonatal risk.","Appleton, A.

We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative of in utero exposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (n = 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (n = 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (n = 583). RESULTS: The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, p = 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, p = 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, p < 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.

Herein, we performed genome-wide methylation sequencing on both tissues and urine samples for RC DNA methylation makers discovery and developed a PCR-based RC early detector (RED) using a cohort of 93 RC and 35 non-RC urine samples. RED further achieved sensitivities of 82.2% and 80.7%, and specificities of 77.1% and 75% in a testing cohort (90 RC vs. 35 non-RC) and a validation cohort (119 RC vs. 48 non-RC), respectively.

This work aims to further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of ARID2-RD, providing clinicians with additional data for better care and aid in the future diagnosis of this condition. We obtained the genotypes and phenotypes of 27 previously unreported individuals with ARID2-RD and compared this series with findings in the literature. We also assessed peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles in individuals with ARID2-RD compared to episignatures of controls, unresolved cases, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The main clinical features of ARID2-RD are developmental delay, speech disorders, intellectual disability (ID), behavior problems, short stature, and various dysmorphic and ectodermal features. Genome-wide differential methylation analysis revealed a global hypermethylated profile in ARID2-RD that could aid in reclassifying variants of uncertain significance. Our study doubles the number of reported individuals with ARID2 pathogenic variants to 53. It confirms loss-of-function as a pathomechanism and shows the absence of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. We provide evidence for a unique DNA methylation episignature for ARID2-RD and further delineate the ARID2-associated phenotype.","['Houdayer, C.', 'Rooney, K.', 'van der Laan, L.', 'Bris, C.', 'Alders, M.', 'Bahr, A.', 'Barcia, G.', 'Battault, C.', 'Begemann, A.', 'Bonneau, D.', 'Bonnevalle, A.', 'Boughalem, A.', 'Bourges, A.', 'Bournez, M.', 'Bruel, A.

However, little is known about the extent of the shared disruption of signaling pathways by the same epigene across different diseases. To address this, we study an epigene, Additional Sex Combs-like 1 (ASXL1), where truncating heterozygous variants cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS, OMIM #605039), a germline neurodevelopmental disorder, while somatic variants are driver events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). No BOS patients have been reported to have AML. METHODS: This study explores common pathways dysregulated by ASXL1 variants in patients with BOS and AML. We analyzed whole blood transcriptomic and DNA methylation data from patients with BOS and AML with ASXL1-variant (AML-ASXL1) and examined differential exon usage and cell proportions. RESULTS: Our analyses identified common molecular signatures between BOS and AML-ASXL1 and highlighted key biomarkers, including VANGL2, GRIK5 and GREM2, that are dysregulated across samples with ASXL1 variants, regardless of disease type. Notably, our data revealed significant de-repression of posterior homeobox A (HOXA) genes and upregulation of Wnt-signaling and hematopoietic regulator HOXB4. While we discovered many shared epigenetic and transcriptomic features, we also identified differential splice isoforms in RUNX3 where the long isoform, p46, is preferentially expressed in BOS, while the shorter p44 isoform is expressed in AML-ASXL1. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the strong effects of ASXL1 variants that supersede cell-type and even disease states. This is the first direct comparison of transcriptomic and methylation profiles driven by pathogenic variants in a chromatin modifier gene in distinct diseases. Similar to RASopathies, in which pathogenic variants in many genes lead to overlapping phenotypes that can be treated by inhibiting a common pathway, our data identifies common pathways for ASXL1 variants that can be targeted for both disease states. Comparative approaches of high-penetrance genetic variants across cell types and disease states can identify targetable pathways to treat multiple diseases. Finally, our work highlights the connections of epigenes, such as ASXL1, to an underlying stem-cell state in both early development and in malignancy.","['Lin, I.', 'Awamleh, Z.', 'Sinvhal, M.', 'Wan, A.', 'Bondhus, L.', 'Wei, A.', 'Russell, B.

The first individuals ascertained carried de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in HNRNPK. Here, we report 32 individuals with AKS (26 previously unpublished), including 13 with de novo missense variants. We propose new clinical diagnostic criteria for AKS that differentiate it from the clinically overlapping Kabuki syndrome and describe a significant phenotypic expansion to include individuals with missense variants who present with subtle facial features and few or no malformations. Many gene-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures have been identified for neurodevelopmental syndromes. Because HNRNPK has roles in chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hypothesized that pathogenic variants in HNRNPK may be associated with a specific DNAm signature. Here, we report a unique DNAm signature for AKS due to LoF HNRNPK variants, distinct from controls and Kabuki syndrome. This DNAm signature is also identified in some individuals with de novo HNRNPK missense variants, confirming their pathogenicity and the phenotypic expansion of AKS to include more subtle phenotypes. Furthermore, we report that some individuals with missense variants have an “intermediate” DNAm signature that parallels their milder clinical presentation, suggesting the presence of an epi-genotype phenotype correlation. In summary, the AKS DNAm signature may help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of AKS. This DNAm signature also effectively supported clinical syndrome delineation and is a valuable aid for variant interpretation in individuals where a clinical diagnosis of AKS is unclear, particularly for mild presentations.","['Choufani, S.', 'McNiven, V.', 'Cytrynbaum, C.', 'Jangjoo, M.', 'Adam, M.

While most of these methylation profile scores (MPSs) are developed in blood tissue, there is growing interest in using less invasive tissues like saliva. The aim of the current study is to probe the cross-tissue intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of MPSs developed in blood applied to saliva DNAm from the same people. While our primary focus is on MPSs that were previously found to be robustly correlated with social determinants of health, including second- and third-generation clocks and MPSs of physiology and cognition, we also report ICC values for first-generation clocks to enable comparison across metrics. We pooled three publicly available datasets that had both saliva and blood DNAm from the same individuals (total n = 107, aged 5-74 years), corrected MPSs for cell composition within each tissue, and computed the cross-tissue ICCs. RESULTS: We found that after correcting for cell composition, saliva-blood cross-tissue ICCs were moderate for second- and third-generation indices of aging and MPSs of physiology and cognition. Specifically, PCGrimAge had the highest ICC (0.76), followed by PCPhenoAge (0.72), a measure of cognitive performance (Epigenetic-g, 0.69), DunedinPACE (0.68), PCGrimAge Acceleration (0.67), PCPhenoAge Acceleration (0.66), an MPS of hs-CRP (0.58), and BMI (0.54). These ICCs appear lower than previous reports on within-tissue ICCs (saliva ICCs range from 0.67 to 0.85, blood ICCs range from 0.73 to 0.93). Cross-tissue ICCs values for first-generation biological age acceleration measures were poor, ranging from 0.19 to 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that applying second- and third-generation MPSs of biological age acceleration and related phenotypes developed in blood to saliva DNAm results in moderate cross-tissue similarity and the precise cross-tissue correspondence differs by measure. While the degree of cross-tissue similarity of several MPSs may suffice for some research settings, it may not be suitable in clinical or commercial applications. Collection of both blood and saliva DNAm samples is necessary to validate existing algorithms and to customize MPSs in saliva DNAm. Copyright © 2025.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis. Exposures: Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score. Results: The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring.","['Zou, R.', 'Boer, O. D.', 'Felix, J.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

BIS is caused by pathogenic variants in SMARCA2, that encodes the catalytic subunit of the superfamily II helicase group of the BRG1 and BRM-associated factors (BAF) forming the BAF complex, a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcriptional regulation. Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype-specific episignature. A distinct episignature was shared by 15 individuals with BIS-causing SMARCA2 pathogenic variants and 12 individuals with class II HVDAS caused by truncating pathogenic ADNP variants. This represents first evidence of a sensitive phenotype-specific episignature biomarker shared across distinct genetic conditions that also exhibit unique gene-specific episignatures.","['Sarli, C.', 'van der Laan, L.', 'Reilly, J.', 'Trajkova, S.', 'Carli, D.', 'Brusco, A.', 'Levy, M.

Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites, which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1× log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (P = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance - thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity. Similarly, it may also function in monitoring the recently envisioned treatment of KMT2B deficiency by inhibition of DNA methylation.","['Mirza-Schreiber, N.', 'Zech, M.', 'Wilson, R.', 'Brunet, T.', 'Wagner, M.', 'Jech, R.', 'Boesch, S.', 'Škorvánek, M.', 'Necpál, J.', 'Weise, D.', 'Weber, S.', 'Mollenhauer, B.', 'Trenkwalder, C.', 'Maier, E.

It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error through recall bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalized linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates. Copyright © 2025.

It is caused by CUL3 (Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase) haploinsufficiency. We collected clinical and molecular data from 26 individuals carrying pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the CUL3 gene, including 20 previously unreported cases. By comparing their DNA methylation (DNAm) classifiers with those of healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by established episignatures, we aimed to create a diagnostic biomarker (episignature) and gain more knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology. We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for patients with pathogenic variants in CUL3 and utilized it to reclassify patients carrying a VUS in the CUL3 gene. Comparative epigenomic analysis revealed similarities between NEDAUS and several other rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with previously identified episignatures, highlighting the broader implication of our findings. In addition, we performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies to explain the variety in clinical presentation between the cases. We discovered a highly accurate DNAm episignature serving as a robust diagnostic biomarker for NEDAUS.

Individuals with early-onset psychosis (EOP) tend to experience a worse prognosis and shorter life expectancy. The etiology of EOP remains unclear, but epigenetic mechanisms are known to serve as the interface between environmental exposures and biological processes to better understand its etiology. Objectives: We characterized the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as genome-wide epigenetic markers, in Mexican patients with EOP. Methods: We estimated epigenetic age, performed an epigenome-wide association study, and finally developed an epigenetic risk score (MRS) to predict manifestations of psychosis. Results: We found that patients with EOP have a higher epigenetic age using Wu's clock (p = 0.015). Moreover, accelerated epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age (PedBE clock, p = 0.046), global functioning (Wu's clock, p = 0.027), and psychiatric admissions (DNAmTL, p = 0.038). In addition, we observed that a reduction in years of schooling is associated with an increase on epigenetic age (Levine's clock, beta = 5.07, p = 0.001). In our epigenome-wide association study, we identified eight CpGs associated with EOP. Noteworthy, a psychosis-methylation risk score (EOP-MRS) was associated with panic disorder (beta = 1.36, p = 0.03), as well as auditory (beta = 1.28, p = 0.04) and visual (beta = 1.22, p = 0.04) hallucinations. Conclusions: Years of education have an impact on epigenetic age. Additionally, our study suggests associations of DNA methylation with EOP.

While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures.

Heterozygous variants in lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), encoding a histone H3 methyltransferase, have been associated with a childhood-onset, progressive and complex form of dystonia (dystonia 28, DYT28). Since 2016, more than one hundred rare KMT2B variants have been reported, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense and other in-frame changes, many having an uncertain clinical impact. RESULTS: We characterize the genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of a cohort of 18 patients with pathogenic and unclassified KMT2B variants. We resolve the ""episignature"" associated with KMT2B haploinsufficiency, proving that this approach is robust in diagnosing clinically unsolved cases, properly classifying them with respect to other partially overlapping dystonic phenotypes, other rare neurodevelopmental disorders and healthy controls. Notably, defective KMT2B function in DYT28 causes a non-random DNA hypermethylation across the genome, selectively involving promoters and other regulatory regions positively controlling gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinctive DNA hypermethylation pattern associated with DYT28, provide an epigenetic signature for this disorder enabling accurate diagnosis and reclassification of ambiguous genetic findings and suggest potential therapeutic approaches.

Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rare KMT2A variants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature for KMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2A gene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease.","['Foroutan, A.', 'Haghshenas, S.', 'Bhai, P.', 'Levy, M.

These episignatures inform on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, the detection of these episignature requires the use of indirect methylation profiling methodologies. We hypothesized that long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants but also episignatures. METHODS: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing was performed in 40 controls and 20 patients with confirmed or suspected episignature-associated DD, representing 13 distinct diseases. Following genomic variant and methylome calling, hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures. Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) for the detection of each DD. RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing-based methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based episignatures. Our SVM-based classifier identified the episignatures in 17/19 patients with a (likely) pathogenic variant and none of the controls. The remaining patients in which no episignature was identified were also classified as controls by a commercial microarray assay. In addition, we identified all underlying pathogenic single nucleotide and structural variants and showed haplotype-aware skewed X-inactivation evaluation directs clinical interpretation. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates nanopore sequencing enables episignature detection. In addition, concurrent haplotyped genomic and epigenomic analyses leverage simultaneous detection of single nucleotide/structural variants, X-inactivation, and imprinting, consolidating a multi-step sequential process into a single diagnostic assay.

This study presents an in-depth clinico-biological analysis of 20 newly reported individuals with BCL11B-RD, coupled with a characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of this genetic condition. Methods: Through an international collaboration, clinical and molecular data from 20 individuals were systematically gathered, and a comparative analysis was conducted between this series and existing literature. We further scrutinized peripheral blood DNA methylation profile of individuals with BCL11B-RD, contrasting them with healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders marked by established episignature. Results: Our findings unveil rarely documented clinical manifestations, notably including Rubinstein-Taybi-like facial features, craniosynostosis, and autoimmune disorders, all manifesting within the realm of BCL11B-RD. We refine the intricacies of T cell compartment alterations of BCL11B-RD, revealing decreased levels naive CD4+ T cells and recent thymic emigrants while concurrently observing an elevated proportion of effector-memory expressing CD45RA CD8+ T cells (TEMRA).

However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them. METHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score > 0.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (< 40), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (> 40), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated. Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age < 40 and lack of TERT promoter mutation. CONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients' risk.

Comprehensive genomic profiling was initiated to aid in diagnosis, prognostication, treatment, and detection of germline disease predisposition in this patient cohort.METHODSEnhanced exome sequencing of disease and comparator tissue was coupled with RNA sequencing of the disease-involved specimen to assess for single nucleotide variation, insertion/deletions, copy number alteration, structural variation, fusions, and methylation profiling-based tumor classification scores.RESULTSAmong 317 patients who consented to the protocol, 39 (12%) had infantile cancers diagnosed at <= 1 year of age. Germline genetic alteration was frequent with 11 of 39 patients (28%) harboring a pathogenic change. Clinically relevant findings affecting diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or surveillance were identified in 37 of 39 (95%) patients.CONCLUSIONOur data support that a pediatric cohort gains significant benefit from a comprehensive profiling approach, with a high yield of clinically significant findings. Nearly half of the infants in this cancer cohort harbored tumors potentially susceptible to therapeutic targets on the basis of genomic profile, and among these, another half sought benefit from therapeutic implementation.","['Mathew, M.

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.","['Giuili, E.', 'Grolaux, R.', 'Macedo, C.

As these genes play a critical role in maintaining methylation status in chromatin, individuals with pathogenic variants have a disease-specific epigenomic profile-an episignature. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the pathogenicity of 3 novel partial KDM6A duplications identified in 3 individuals presenting with neonatal-onset HI without typical features of KS at the time of genetic testing. METHODS: Three different partial KDM6A duplications were identified by routine targeted next-generation sequencing for HI and initially classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as their location, and hence their impact on the gene, was not known. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was undertaken to map the breakpoints of the duplications with DNA methylation profiling performed in 2 individuals to investigate the presence of a KS-specific episignature. RESULTS: WGS confirmed the duplication in proband 1 as pathogenic as it caused a frameshift in the normal copy of the gene leading to a premature termination codon. The duplications identified in probands 2 and 3 did not alter the reading frame, and therefore their significance remained uncertain after WGS. Subsequent DNA methylation profiling identified a KS-specific episignature in proband 2 but not in proband 3. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm a role for KDM6A partial gene duplications in the etiology of KS and highlight the importance of performing in-depth molecular genetic analysis to properly assess the clinical significance of VUS' in the KDM6A gene.

DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming. Methods: Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings. Results: Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e−05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e−07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e−04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.","['Alfano, R.', 'Zugna, D.', 'Barros, H.', 'Bustamante, M.', 'Chatzi, L.', 'Ghantous, A.', 'Herceg, Z.', 'Keski-Rahkonen, P.', 'de Kok, T.

Methods: Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified. Results: Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data. Conclusion: Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis.

Pregnant women disproportionately underreport smoking and smokers tend to have lower follow-up rates to repeat questionnaires. Missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data on presence and duration of smoking in pregnancy impairs identification of novel health effects and limits adjustment for smoking in studies of other pregnancy exposures. An objective biomarker in newborns of maternal smoking during pregnancy would be valuable. OBJECTIVES: We developed a biomarker of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy using common DNA methylation platforms. METHODS: Using a dimension reduction method, we developed and tested a numeric score in newborns to reflect sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy from data on cotinine, a short-term smoking biomarker measured mid-pregnancy, and Illumina450K cord blood DNA methylation from newborns in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). RESULTS: This score reliably predicted smoking status in the training set (n = 1,057; accuracy = 96%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 98%). Sensitivity (58%) was predictably lower in the much smaller test set (n = 221), but accuracy (91%) and specificity (97%) remained high. Reduced birth weight, a well-known effect of maternal smoking, was as strongly related to the score as to cotinine. A three-site score had lower, but acceptable, performance (accuracytrain = 82%, accuracytest = 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Our smoking methylation score represents a promising novel biomarker of sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy easily calculated with Illumina450K or IlluminaEPIC data. It may help identify novel health impacts and improve adjustment for smoking when studying other risk factors with more subtle effects.","['Reese, S. E.', 'Zhao, S.', 'Wu, M. C.', 'Joubert, B.

We analyzed 97 NDDs divided into (1) a validation cohort of 59 patients with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants characterized by a known episignature and (2) a test cohort of 38 patients harboring variants of unknown significance or unidentified variants. The expected episignature was obtained in most cases with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (53/59 [90%]), a revealing exception being the overlapping profile of two SMARCB1 pathogenic variants with ARID1A/B:c.6200, confirmed by the overlapping clinical features. In the test cohort, five cases showed the expected episignature, including (1) novel pathogenic variants in ARID1B and BRWD3; (2) a deletion in ATRX causing MRXFH1 X-linked mental retardation; and (3) confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Cornelia de Lange (CdL) syndrome in mutation-negative CdL patients. Episignatures analysis of the in BAF complex components revealed novel functional protein interactions and common episignatures affecting homologous residues in highly conserved paralogous proteins (SMARCA2 M856V and SMARCA4 M866V). Finally, we also found sex-dependent episignatures in X-linked disorders. Implementation of episignature profiling is still in its early days, but with increasing utilization comes increasing awareness of the capacity of this methodology to help resolve the complex challenges of genetic diagnoses.","['Trajkova, S.', 'Kerkhof, J.', 'Rossi Sebastiano, M.', 'Pavinato, L.', 'Ferrero, E.', 'Giovenino, C.', 'Carli, D.', 'Di Gregorio, E.', 'Marinoni, R.', 'Mandrile, G.', 'Palermo, F.', 'Carestiato, S.', 'Cardaropoli, S.', 'Pullano, V.', 'Rinninella, A.', 'Giorgio, E.', 'Pippucci, T.', 'Dimartino, P.', 'Rzasa, J.', 'Rooney, K.', 'McConkey, H.', 'Petlichkovski, A.', 'Pasini, B.', 'Sukarova-Angelovska, E.', 'Campbell, C.

However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization. Conclusion: The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.","['Kilanowski, A.', 'Merid, S.

However, the biological mechanisms connecting PTE and PAE, DNAm, and neurodevelopment are largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether differential DNAm mediates the association between PTE and PAE and neurodevelopment at 6 (N = 112) and 24 months (N = 184) in children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. PTE and PAE were assessed antenatally using urine cotinine measurements and the ASSIST questionnaire, respectively. Cord blood DNAm was measured using the EPIC and 450 K BeadChips. Neurodevelopment (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behavior, socioemotional) was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We constructed methylation risk scores (MRS) for PTE and PAE and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) with these MRS as mediators. Next, we conducted a high-dimensional mediation analysis to identify individual CpG sites as potential mediators, followed by a CMA to estimate the average causal mediation effects (ACME) and total effect (TE). PTE and PAE were associated with neurodevelopment at 6 but not at 24 months. PTE MRS reached a prediction accuracy (R2) of 0.23 but did not significantly mediate the association between PTE and neurodevelopment. PAE MRS was not predictive of PAE (R2 = 0.006). For PTE, 31 CpG sites and eight CpG sites were identified as significant mediators (ACME and TE P < 0.05) for the cognitive and motor domains at 6 months, respectively. For PAE, 16 CpG sites and 1 CpG site were significant mediators for the motor and adaptive behavior domains at 6 months, respectively. Several of the associated genes, including MAD1L1, CAMTA1, and ALDH1A2 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting that differential DNAm may partly explain the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTE and PAE and child neurodevelopment.

DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for neurodevelopment that is altered in schizophrenia, is a key molecular system of interest. METHODS: In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm in cord blood with LVV in childhood (measured using T1-weighted brain scans at 10 years), based on data from a large population-based birth cohort, the Generation R Study (N = 840). Employing both probe-level and methylation profile score (MPS) approaches, we further examined whether epigenetic modifications identified at birth in cord blood are: (a) also observed cross-sectionally in childhood using peripheral blood DNAm at age of 10 years (Generation R, N = 370) and (b) prospectively associated with LVV measured in young adulthood in an all-male sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 114). RESULTS: At birth, DNAm levels at four CpGs (annotated to potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, KCTD3; SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator, SDCCAG8; glutaredoxin, GLRX) prospectively associated with childhood LVV after genome-wide correction; these genes have been implicated in brain development and psychiatric traits including schizophrenia. An MPS capturing a broader epigenetic profile of LVV - but not individual top hits - showed significant cross-sectional associations with LVV in childhood in Generation R and prospectively associated with LVV in early adulthood within ALSPAC. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds suggestive evidence that DNAm at birth prospectively associates with LVV at different life stages, albeit with small effect sizes. The prediction of MPS on LVV in a childhood sample and an independent male adult sample further underscores the stability and reproducibility of DNAm as a potential marker for LVV.

It is caused by a variable size and breakpoint microdeletions in the distal long arm of chromosome 22, referred to as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, including the SHANK3 gene. Genetic defects in a growing number of neurodevelopmental genes have been shown to cause genome-wide disruptions in epigenomic profiles referred to as epi-signatures in affected individuals. Results: In this study we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 22 individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including 11 individuals with large (2 to 5.8 Mb) 22q13.3 deletions, 10 with small deletions (< 1 Mb) or intragenic variants in SHANK3 and one mosaic case. We describe a novel genome-wide DNA methylation epi-signature in a subset of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Conclusion: We identified the critical region including the BRD1 gene as responsible for the Phelan-McDermid syndrome epi-signature.

Methods: We studied the phenotypic characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the identification of the episignature and building of a predictive diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples.

METHODS: From the Treatment of Obese Pregnant Women (TOP) study, 232 mother-child pairs were included. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on prePregBMI and CB DNAm (450k array), followed by causal mediation analyses to test whether DNAm may mediate effects of prePregBMI on BMIz at age 36 months (BMIz36). RESULTS: DNAm at 5345 CpG sites annotated to 2842 genes, which were overrepresented in biological processes linked to carbohydrate metabolism and plasma lipoprotein particle clearance, was associated with prePregBMI (false discovery rate < 10%). Causal mediation analyses of 168 methylation sites associated with BMIz36 (p < 0.05) and overlapping with the 5345 prePregBMI-associated sites identified two sites on SYT7 and DEAF1, partially mediating the effect of prePregBMI on BMIz36 (p <= 0.01). After cross-validation, a methylation risk score including these two sites could predict the highest quartile of BMIz36 and fat mass (in grams) with area under the curve = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85) and area under the curve = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85), respectively.

Here we investigate and provide descriptive details of the capacity of DNAm to capture non-genetic variation in protein abundance across the lifecourse. We evaluated the performance of 14 previously published DNAm models of protein abundance (episcores) in peripheral blood from a large adult population using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at ages 7–24 and their mothers antenatally and in middle age (N range = 145–1464). New age-specific episcores were trained in ALSPAC and evaluated at different ages. In all instances, episcore–protein associations were evaluated with and without adjustment for genetics. The association between longitudinal protein stability and longitudinal episcore projection was also evaluated, as was sex-specificity of episcores derived solely in female participants. Of the 14 Gadd episcores, 10 generated estimates associated with abundance in middle age, 9 at age 24, and none at age 9. Eight of these episcores explained variation beyond genotype in adulthood (6 at age 24; 7 at midlife). At age 9, the abundances of 22 proteins could be modelled by DNAm, 7 beyond genotype of which one trained model generated informative estimates at ages 24 and in middle age. At age 24, 31 proteins could be modelled by DNAm, 19 beyond genotype, of which 5 trained models generated informative estimates at age 9 and 8 in middle age. In middle age, 23 proteins could be modelled, 13 beyond genotype, of which 3 were informative at age 9 and 7 at age 24. We observed that episcores performed better at older ages than in children with several episcores capturing non-genetic variation at all ages.","['Waterfield, Scott', 'Yousefi, Paul', 'Suderman,

Schepke et al.,2022.0,DNA methylation profiling improves routine diagnosis of paediatric central nervous system tumours: A prospective population-based study,10.1111/nan.12838,1.0,Central nervous system tumour ,Cancer,,Pre-established MPS,240.0,,,Cohort study,Childhood and adolescence,Tumour cells,EPICv1,European,Journal Article,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,,"AIMS: Paediatric brain tumours are rare, and establishing a precise diagnosis can be challenging. Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort. METHODS: All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist. RESULTS: Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time. The MRSs have the potential to be a novel clinical biomarker for the assessment of trauma-related health risks. Copyright © 2022.

AIM: This study examined whether DNA methylation signatures of prenatal SEP, measured in birth samples, are associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months of age. METHODS: Prenatal SEP DNA methylation scores were derived using 97 placenta and 127 cord blood biospecimens in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation cohort. Participants completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) at 36 months of age. Generalized regression analyses, adjusting for maternal age and race, were performed to test the association between SEP methylation score, for each birth biospecimen type, and MSEL and VABS scores. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between placenta SEP methylation score and MSEL Expressive Language outcomes (beta = -2.7, p = 0.046, 95% CI [- 5.43, -0.05]) and Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.5, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-4.82, -0.16]). In cord blood, methylation-SEP scores were significantly associated with Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.0, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-3.85, -0.12]). No significant associations were observed with VABS scores.

TET3 deficiency, or Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS; MIM: 618798), is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder of the DNA demethylation machinery with a nonspecific phenotype resembling other chromatin-modifying disorders, but inconsistent variant types and inheritance patterns pose diagnostic challenges. Given TET3’s direct role in regulating 5-methylcytosine and recent identification of syndrome-specific DNA methylation profiles, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood of TET3-deficient individuals and identified an episignature that distinguishes affected and unaffected individuals and those with mono-allelic and bi-allelic pathogenic variants. Validation and testing of the episignature correctly categorized known TET3 variants and determined pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. Clinical utility was demonstrated when the episignature alone identified an affected individual from over 1000 undiagnosed cases and was confirmed upon distinguishing TET3-deficient individuals from those with 46 other disorders. The TET3-deficient signature - and the signature resulting from activating mutations in DNMT1 which normally opposes TET3 - are characterized by hypermethylation, which for BEFAHRS involves CpG sites that may be biologically relevant. This work expands the role of epi-phenotyping in molecular diagnosis and reveals genome-wide DNA methylation profiling as a quantitative, functional readout for characterization of this new biochemical category of disease.","['Levy, M.

Lysine-demethylase 2B (KDM2B) encodes an epigenetic regulator and mouse models suggest an important role during development. We set out to determine whether KDM2B variants are associated with NDD. Methods: Through international collaborations, we collected data on individuals with heterozygous KDM2B variants. We applied methylation arrays on peripheral blood DNA samples to determine a KDM2B associated epigenetic signature. Results: We recruited a total of 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in KDM2B. We present evidence, including a shared epigenetic signature, to support a pathogenic classification of 15 KDM2B variants and identify the CxxC domain as a mutational hotspot. Both loss-of-function and CxxC-domain missense variants present with a specific subepisignature. Moreover, the KDM2B episignature was identified in the context of a dual molecular diagnosis in multiple individuals. Our efforts resulted in a cohort of 21 individuals with heterozygous (likely) pathogenic variants. Individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; congenital organ anomalies mainly of the heart, eyes, and urogenital system; and subtle facial dysmorphism. Conclusion: Pathogenic heterozygous variants in KDM2B are associated with NDD and a specific epigenetic signature detectable in peripheral blood.","['van Jaarsveld, R. H.', 'Reilly, J.', 'Cornips, M.

In this study, we assessed the peripheral blood specimens in a cohort of individuals with MRXSA and detected a unique and highly specific DNA methylation episignature associated with this disorder. We used this episignature to construct a support vector machine model capable of sensitive and specific identification of individuals with pathogenic variants in FAM50A. This study contributes to the expanding number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with defined DNA methylation episignatures, provides an additional understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms, and further enhances our ability to diagnose patients with rare disorders.","['Haghshenas, S.', 'Levy, M.

Negative effects of MSDP on placental DNA methylation (DNAm), placental structure, and function are well established. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop biomarkers of MSDP using DNAm measured in placentas (N = 96), collected as part of the Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted between 2012 and 2016. We also aimed to develop a digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the top ranking cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) so that large numbers of samples can be screened for exposure at low cost. METHODS: We compared the ability of four machine learning methods [logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosting machine] to classify MSDP based on placental DNAm signatures. We developed separate models using the complete EPIC array dataset and on the subset of probes also found on the 450K array so that models exist for both platforms. For comparison, we developed a model using CpGs previously associated with MSDP in placenta. For each final model, we used model coefficients and normalized beta values to calculate placental smoking index (PSI) scores for each sample. Final models were validated in two external datasets: the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn observational study, N = 426; and the Rhode Island Children's Health Study, N = 237. RESULTS: Logistic LASSO regression demonstrated the highest performance in cross-validation testing with the lowest number of input CpGs. Accuracy was greatest in external datasets when using models developed for the same platform. PSI scores in smokers only (n = 72) were moderately correlated with maternal plasma cotinine levels. One CpG (cg27402634), with the largest coefficient in two models, was measured accurately by digital PCR compared with measurement by EPIC array (R2 = 0.98). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, we have developed the first placental DNAm-based biomarkers of MSDP with broad utility to studies of prenatal disease origins. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13838.","['Shorey-Kendrick, L.

We aimed to explore relationship between prenatal exposures and adolescent's psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits mediated through epigenetic biomarkers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used data from mother-child dyads from pregnancy and adolescents at 16-17 years from two prospective cohorts: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) and Raine Study from Australia. Factor analysis was applied to generate two different latent factor structures: (a) prenatal exposures and (b) adolescence psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits. Furthermore, three types of epigenetic biomarkers were included: (1) DNA methylation score for maternal smoking during pregnancy (DNAmMSS), (2) DNAm age estimate PhenoAge and (3) DNAm estimate for telomere length (DNAmTL). Similar factor structure was observed between both cohorts yielding three prenatal factors, namely BMI (Body Mass Index), SOP (Socio-Obstetric-Profile), and Lifestyle, and four adolescent factors: Anthropometric, Insulin-Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, and Mental health. In the SEM pathways, stronger direct effects of F1prenatal-BMI (NFBC1986 = beta: 0.27; Raine = beta: 0.39) and F2prenatal-SOP (beta: -0.11) factors were observed on adolescent psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We observed an indirect effect of prenatal latent factors through epigenetic markers on a psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity factor in Raine study (P < 0.05). The present study exemplifies an evidence-based approach in two different birth cohorts to demonstrate similar composite structure of prenatal exposures and psycho-cardiometabolic traits (despite cultural, social, and genetic differences) and a common plausible pathway between them through underlying epigenetic markers.

Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unresolved ND/CAs. We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model in resolving 67 individuals with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases and highlights the potential value of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assessment of ND/CAs.","['Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Bend, E.

Most individuals have non-recurrent missense variants, complicating variant interpretation. A few were reported with truncating variants, and their role in disease is unclear. DNA methylation episignatures have emerged as highly accurate diagnostic biomarkers in a growing number of rare diseases. We aimed to study evidence for the existence of a CHD4-related DNA methylation episignature. We collected blood DNA samples and/or clinical information from 39 individuals with CHD4 variants, including missense and truncating variants. Genomic DNA methylation analysis was performed on 28 samples. We identified a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature in samples with pathogenic missense variants within the ATPase/helicase domain. The same episignature was observed in a family with variable expressivity, a de novo variant near the PHD domain, variants of uncertain significance within the ATPase/helicase domain, and a sample with compound heterozygous variants. DNA methylation data revealed higher percentages of shared probes with BAFopathies, CHD8, and the terminal ADNP variants encoding a protein known to form the ChAHP complex with CHD4. Truncating variants, as well as a sample with a recurrent pathogenic missense variant, exhibited DNA methylation profiles distinct from the ATPase/helicase domain episignature. These DNA methylation differences, together with the distinct clinical features observed in those individuals, provide preliminary evidence for clinical and molecular sub-types in the CHD4-related disorder.

Variants in RNU4-2, encoding U4, cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called ReNU syndrome. We investigated de novo variants in 50 snRNA-encoding genes in a French cohort of 23,649 individuals with rare disorders and gathered additional cases through international collaborations. Altogether, we identified 145 previously unreported probands with (likely) pathogenic variants in RNU4-2 and 21 individuals with de novo and/or recurrent variants in RNU5B-1 and RNU5A-1, encoding U5. Pathogenic variants typically arose de novo on the maternal allele and cluster in regions critical for splicing. RNU4-2 variants mainly localize to two structures, the stem III and T-loop/quasi-pseudoknot, which position the U6 ACAGAGA box for 5' splice site recognition and associate with different phenotypic severity. RNU4-2 variants result in specific defects in alternative 5' splice site usage and methylation patterns (episignatures) that correlate with variant location and clinical severity. This study establishes RNU5B-1 as a neurodevelopmental disorder gene, suggests RNU5A-1 as a strong candidate and highlights the role of de novo variants in snRNAs. Copyright © 2025.

However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N = up-to 6401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; beta = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020-0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

We recently reported an association between an epigenetic biomarker of early-life tobacco smoke exposure at the AHRR gene and increased frequency of somatic gene deletions among ALL cases. METHODS: Here, we further assess this association using two epigenetic biomarkers for maternal smoking during pregnancy-DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and a recently established polyepigenetic smoking score-in an expanded set of 482 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases in the California Childhood Leukemia Study with available Illumina 450K or MethylationEPIC array data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the associations between the epigenetic biomarkers and gene deletion numbers. RESULTS: We found an association between DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion number among 284 childhood B-ALL cases with MethylationEPIC array data, with a ratio of means (RM) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.69] for each 0.1 beta value reduction in DNA methylation, an effect size similar to our previous report in an independent set of 198 B-ALL cases with 450K array data [meta-analysis summary RM (sRM) = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57]. The polyepigenetic smoking score was positively associated with gene deletion frequency among all 482 B-ALL cases (sRM = 1.31 for each 4-unit increase in score; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence that prenatal tobacco-smoke exposure may influence the generation of somatic copy-number deletions in childhood B-ALL. IMPACT: Analyses of deletion breakpoint sequences are required to further understand the mutagenic effects of tobacco smoke in childhood ALL.

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

ZNF699 encodes a KRAB zinc finger protein of unknown function. We aimed to investigate the genotype-phenotype spectrum of DEGCAGS and the possibility of a diagnostic DNA methylation episignature, to facilitate the diagnosis of a highly variable condition lacking pathognomonic clinical findings. We collected data on 30 affected individuals (12 new). GestaltMatcher analyzed fifty-three facial photographs from five individuals. In nine individuals, methylation profiling of blood-DNA was performed, and a classification model was constructed to differentiate DEGCAGS from controls. We expand the ZNF699-related molecular spectrum and show that biallelic, LoF, ZNF699 variants cause unique clinical findings with age-related presentation and a similar facial gestalt. We also identified a robust episignature for DEGCAGS syndrome. DEGCAGS syndrome is a clinically variable recessive syndrome even among siblings with a distinct methylation episignature which can be used as a screening, diagnostic and classification tool for ZNF699 variants. Analysis of differentially methylated regions suggested an effect on genes potentially implicated in the syndrome's pathogenesis. Copyright © 2024.

TRIP12 encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway. The ubiquitin pathway includes activating E1, conjugating E2 and ligating E3 enzymes which regulate the breakdown and sorting of proteins. This enzymatic pathway is crucial for physiological processes. A significant proportion of TRIP12 variants are currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Episignatures have been shown to represent a powerful diagnostic tool to resolve inconclusive genetic findings for Mendelian disorders and to re-classify VUSs. Here, we show the results of DNA methylation episignature analysis in 32 individuals with pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS variants in TRIP12. We identified a specific and sensitive DNA methylation (DNAm) episignature associated with pathogenic TRIP12 variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for Clark–Baraitser syndrome.

However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.

An expanding number of genetic syndromes have been shown to have unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called ""episignatures""). Peripheral blood episignatures can be used for diagnostic testing as well as for the interpretation of ambiguous genetic test results. We present here an approach to episignature mapping in 42 genetic syndromes, which has allowed the identification of 34 robust disease-specific episignatures. We examine emerging patterns of overlap, as well as similarities and hierarchical relationships across these episignatures, to highlight their key features as they are related to genetic heterogeneity, dosage effect, unaffected carrier status, and incomplete penetrance. We demonstrate the necessity of multiclass modeling for accurate genetic variant classification and show how disease classification using a single episignature at a time can sometimes lead to classification errors in closely related episignatures. We demonstrate the utility of this tool in resolving ambiguous clinical cases and identification of previously undiagnosed cases through mass screening of a large cohort of subjects with developmental delays and congenital anomalies. This study more than doubles the number of published syndromes with DNA methylation episignatures and, most significantly, opens new avenues for accurate diagnosis and clinical assessment in individuals affected by these disorders.","['Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Kerkhof, J.', 'Pedro, V.

As microarray platforms continue to evolve and increase the scope of CpGs measured, new discoveries based on the most recent platform version and how they compare to available data from the previous versions of the platform are unknown. The neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI 850) is a blood-based DNA methylation biomarker built on the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array that measures epigenetic responses to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid often administered for inflammation. Here, we compare the NDMI 850 to one we built using data from the Illumina Methylation 450K (NDMI 450). RESULTS: The NDMI 450 consisted of 22 loci, 15 of which were present on the NDMI 850. In adult whole blood samples, the linear composite scores from NDMI 450 and NDMI 850 were highly correlated and had equivalent predictive accuracy for detecting DEX exposure among adult glioma patients and non-glioma adult controls. However, the NDMI 450 scores of newborn cord blood were significantly lower than NDMI 850 in samples measured with both assays. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an algorithm that reproduces the DNA methylation glucocorticoid response score using 450K data, increasing the accessibility for researchers to assess this biomarker in archived or publicly available datasets that use the 450K version of the Illumina BeadChip array. However, the NDMI850 and NDMI450 do not give similar results in cord blood, and due to data availability limitations, results from sample types of newborn cord blood should be interpreted with care.

It is caused by truncating mutations in ADNP, which is involved in chromatin regulation. We hypothesized that the disruption of chromatin regulation might result in specific DNA methylation patterns that could be used in the molecular diagnosis of ADNP syndrome. RESULTS: We identified two distinct and partially opposing genomic DNA methylation episignatures in the peripheral blood samples from 22 patients with ADNP syndrome. The ""epi-ADNP-1"" episignature included ~ 6000 mostly hypomethylated CpGs, and the ""epi-ADNP-2"" episignature included ~ 1000 predominantly hypermethylated CpGs. The two signatures correlated with the locations of the ADNP mutations. Epi-ADNP-1 mutations occupy the N- and C-terminus, and epi-ADNP-2 mutations are centered on the nuclear localization signal. The episignatures were enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A classifier trained on these profiles yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with either of the two episignatures. Applying this model to seven patients with uncertain clinical diagnosis enabled reclassification of genetic variants of uncertain significance and assigned new diagnosis when the primary clinical suspicion was not correct. When applied to a large cohort of unresolved patients with developmental delay (N = 1150), the model predicted three additional previously undiagnosed patients to have ADNP syndrome. DNA sequencing of these subjects, wherever available, identified pathogenic mutations within the gene domains predicted by the model. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first Mendelian condition with two distinct episignatures caused by mutations in a single gene. These highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignatures enable diagnosis, screening, and genetic variant classifications in ADNP syndrome.","['Bend, E. G.', 'Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Everman, D.

The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).

This interaction is thought to occur through epigenetic mechanisms, inducing differential gene expression, thereby moderating neuronal cell and circuit function, and thus shaping aggressive behaviour. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels were measured in peripheral blood obtained from 95 individuals participating in the Estonian Children Personality Behaviours and Health Study (ECPBHS) at 15 and 25 years of age. We examined the association between aggressive behaviour, as measured by Life History of Aggression (LHA) total score and DNAm levels both assessed at age 25. We further examined the pleiotropic effect of genetic variants regulating LHA-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and multiple traits related to aggressive behaviours. Lastly, we tested whether the DNA methylomic loci identified in association with LHA at age 25 were also present at age 15. RESULTS: We found one differentially methylated position (DMP) (cg17815886; p = 1.12 x 10-8 ) and five differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LHA after multiple testing adjustments. The DMP annotated to the PDLIM5 gene, and DMRs resided in the vicinity of four protein-encoding genes (TRIM10, GTF2H4, SLC45A4, B3GALT4) and a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC02068). We observed evidence for the colocalization of genetic variants associated with top DMPs and general cognitive function, educational attainment and cholesterol levels. Notably, a subset of the DMPs associated with LHA at age 25 also displayed altered DNAm patterns at age 15 with high accuracy in predicting aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential role of DNAm in the development of aggressive behaviours. We observed pleiotropic genetic variants associated with identified DMPs, and various traits previously established to be relevant in shaping aggression in humans. The concordance of DNAm signatures in adolescents and young adults may have predictive value for inappropriate and maladaptive aggression later in life. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on patients with PURA variants, we aim to establish a PURA-NDD-specific methylation profile and provide further insights on the molecular basis of the PURA-NDD. METHODS: Twenty three individuals (including 12 unpublished) carrying PURA variants were enrolled. We conducted the Illumina Infinium EPIC microarray analysis in 17 PURA-NDD individuals. In vitro experiments were performed to examine how PURA variants affect Pur-a expression. RESULTS: Additional phenotypes in 12 newly identified patients were described in this study. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis unveiled distinctive methylation profiles to PURA-NDD, and the established classifier can reclassify PURA variants of uncertain significance. Patients bearing PURA hapoloinsufficient and missense variants have comparable DNA methylation profiles, and cells expressing these PURA variants showed consistent Pur-a downregulation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism.

The mechanistic cross-talk between histone modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures, we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical and molecular features associated with the disruption of the epigenetic machinery.","['Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Rodenhiser, D.

DNAm in specific sites can also predict newborn gestational age and gestational age acceleration (GAA). GAA occurs when the predicted biological age is higher than the chronological age. In adults, poor health outcomes related to this deviance are well documented and raise questions for the interpretation and prediction in early stages of life. Boys seem to be more vulnerable to intrauterine stress exposure than girls; however, the mechanisms of adaptive sex-specific responses are still unclear. We hypothesize that intrauterine stress exposure is associated with GAA and could be different in boys and girls if inflammatory or glucocorticoid pathways exposure is considered. RESULTS: Using the Western Region Birth Cohort (ROC-Sao Paulo, Brazil) (n = 83), we calculated DNAm age and GAA from cord blood samples. Two epigenetic risk scores were calculated as an indirect proxy for low-grade inflammation (i-ePGS) and for glucocorticoid exposure (GES). Multivariate linear regression models were applied to investigate associations of GAA with prenatal exposures. The i-ePGS and GES were included in different models with the same co-variates considering sex interactions. The first multivariate model investigating inflammatory exposure (adj. R2 = 0.31, p = < 0.001) showed that GAA was positively associated with i-ePGS (CI, 0.26-113.87, p = 0.049) and negative pregnancy-related feelings (CI, 0.04-0.48 p = 0.019). No sex interaction was observed. The second model investigating glucocorticoid exposure (adj. R2 = 0.32, p = < 0.001) showed that the higher was the GAA was associated with a lower the lower was the GES in girls (CI, 0.04-2.55, p = 0.044). In both models, maternal self-reported mental disorder was negatively associated with GAA. CONCLUSION: Prenatal epigenetic score of exposure to low-grade inflammatory was a predictor of GAA for both sexes. Glucocorticoid epigenetic score seems to be more important to GAA in girls. This study supports the evidence of sex-specificity in stress response, suggesting the glucocorticoid as a possible pathway adopted by girls to accelerate the maturation in an adverse condition.

This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] <= 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression >= 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.","['Provencal, N.', 'Arloth, J.', 'Cattaneo, A.', 'Anacker, C.', 'Cattane, N.', 'Wiechmann, T.', 'Roh, S.', 'Kodel, M.', 'Klengel, T.', 'Czamara, D.', 'Muller, N.

Methods: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood of 16 individuals with clinical features and genetic findings consistent with IDD21. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip microarrays. The methylation levels were fitted in a multivariate linear regression model to identify the differentially methylated probes. A binary support vector machine classification model was constructed to differentiate IDD21 samples from controls. Results: We identified a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive episignature associated with CTCF variants. Six variants of uncertain significance were tested, of which 2 mapped to the IDD21 episignature and clustered alongside IDD21 cases in both heatmap and multidimensional scaling plots. Comparison of the genomic DNA methylation profile of IDD21 with that of 56 other neurodevelopmental disorders provided insights into the underlying molecular pathophysiology of this disorder.

Atypical deletions (proximal, distal or nested) are rare and characterized mainly by normal phenotype or mild intellectual disability and variable clinical features. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this disorder are not completely understood. Because the 22q11.2 region harbours genes coding for transcriptional factors and chromatin remodelers, in this study, we performed analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of peripheral blood from 49 patients with 22q11.2DS using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip arrays.

The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.","['Pagliara, D.', 'Ciolfi, A.', 'Pedace, L.', 'Haghshenas, S.', 'Ferilli, M.', 'Levy, M.

MOWS is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, typical facial phenotype and other anomalies, such as short stature, Hirschsprung disease, brain and heart defects. Despite some recognizable features, MOWS rarity and phenotypic variability may complicate its diagnosis, particularly in the neonatal period. In order to define a novel diagnostic biomarker for MOWS, we determined the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of DNA samples from 29 individuals with confirmed clinical and molecular diagnosis. Through multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified and validated a DNA methylation signature involving 296 differentially methylated probes as part of the broader MOWS DNA methylation profile. The prevalence of hypomethylated CpG sites agrees with the main role of ZEB2 as a transcriptional repressor, while differential methylation within the ZEB2 locus supports the previously proposed autoregulation ability. Correlation studies compared the MOWS cohort with 56 previously described DNA methylation profiles of other neurodevelopmental disorders, further validating the specificity of this biomarker. In conclusion, MOWS DNA methylation signature is highly sensitive and reproducible, providing a useful tool to facilitate diagnosis.","['Caraffi, Stefano Giuseppe', 'van der Laan, Liselot', 'Rooney, Kathleen', 'Trajkova, Slavica', 'Zuntini, Roberta', 'Relator, Raissa', 'Haghshenas, Sadegheh', 'Levy, Michael A.', 'Baldo, Chiara', 'Mandrile, Giorgia', 'Lauzon, Carolyn', 'Cordelli, Duccio Maria', 'Ivanovski, Ivan', 'Fetta, Anna', 'Sukarova, Elena', 'Brusco, Alfredo', 'Pavinato, Lisa', 'Pullano, Verdiana', 'Zollino, Marcella', 'McConkey, Haley', 'Tartaglia, Marco', 'Ferrero, Giovanni Battista', 'Sadikovic, Bekim', 'Garavelli, Livia']",2024-06-01,Association DNAm phenotype | P-value | top-ranking ?,Association DNAm phenotype | AUC | top-ranking ?,,,,Machine learning | Support vector machine,Train/test split: 80/20% | leave-one-out cross-validation,Yes (remaining EKD),Not reported,No,No,Cell type

DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00 to 4.71 , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 0.218 ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 0.371 ), independent of other confounding exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects.

In light of the existence of a distinct subsignature, we set out to determine if KDM2B CxxC variants are associated with a unique phenotype and disease mechanism. We recruited individuals with heterozygous CxxC variants and assessed the variants' effect on protein expression and DNA-binding ability. We analyzed clinical data from 19 individuals, including ten previously undescribed individuals with seven novel CxxC variants. The core phenotype of the KDM2B-CxxC cohort is more extensive as compared to that of individuals with KDM2B haploinsufficiency. All individuals with CxxC variants presented with developmental delay, mainly in the speech and motor domain, in addition to variable intellectual disability and mild facial dysmorphism. Congenital heart defects were observed in up to 78% of individuals, with additional common findings including musculoskeletal, ophthalmological, and urogenital anomalies, as well as behavioral challenges and feeding difficulties. Functional assays revealed that while mutant KDM2B protein with CxxC variants can be expressed in vitro, its DNA-binding ability is significantly reduced compared to wildtype. This study shows that KDM2B CxxC variants cause a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome, possibly through a molecular mechanism different from haploinsufficiency.","['van Oirsouw, A. S.

Pathogenic variation in epigenetic regulators can impair deposition of histone post-translational modifications leading to aberrant spatiotemporal gene expression during neurodevelopment. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a prominent multi-subunit epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is responsible for histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). Using exome sequencing, here we identify a cohort of 25 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants in MSL complex member MSL2. MSL2 variants were associated with NDD phenotypes including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and motor issues such as coordination problems, feeding difficulties, and gait disturbance. Dysmorphisms and behavioral and/or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and to a lesser extent, seizures, connective tissue disease signs, sleep disturbance, vision problems, and other organ anomalies, were observed in affected individuals. As a molecular biomarker, a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature has been established. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from three members of our cohort exhibited reduced MSL2 levels. Remarkably, while NDD-associated variants in two other members of the MSL complex (MOF and MSL3) result in reduced H4K16ac, global H4K16ac levels are unchanged in iPSCs with MSL2 variants. Regardless, MSL2 variants altered the expression of MSL2 targets in iPSCs and upon their differentiation to early germ layers. Our study defines an MSL2-related disorder as an NDD with distinguishable clinical features, a specific blood DNA episignature, and a distinct, MSL2-specific molecular etiology compared to other MSL complex-related disorders.","['Karayol, R.', 'Borroto, M.

Maternal smoking may induce such long-term effects through persistent changes in the DNA methylome, which therefore hold the potential to be used as a biomarker of this early life exposure. With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier (""Reese Score"") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.","['Rauschert, S.', 'Melton, P.

However, its use has been primarily limited to adults or preterm infants, and little is known about determinants for - or offspring outcomes of - elevated levels of this epigenetic proxy in cord blood. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map prenatal predictors and long-term neurobehavioral outcomes of neonatal inflammation, as assessed with an epigenetic proxy of inflammation in cord blood, in the general pediatric population. METHODS: Our study was embedded in the prospective population-based Generation R Study (n = 2,394). We created a methylation profile score of CRP (MPS-CRP) in cord blood as a marker of neonatal inflammation and validated it against serum CRP levels in mothers during pregnancy, as well as offspring at birth and in childhood. We then examined (i) which factors (previously associated with sustained inflammation) explain variability in MPS-CRP at birth, including a wide range of prenatal lifestyle and clinical conditions, pro-inflammatory exposures, as well as child genetic liability to elevated CRP levels; and (ii) whether MPS-CRP at birth associates with child neurobehavioral outcomes, including global structural MRI and DTI measures (child mean age 10 and 14 years) as well as psychiatric symptoms over time (Child Behavioral Checklist, at mean age 1.5, 3, 6, 10 and 14 years). RESULTS: MPS-CRP at birth was validated with serum CRP in cord blood (cut-off > 1 mg/L) (AUC = 0.72). Prenatal lifestyle pro-inflammatory factors explained a small part (i.e., < 5%) of the variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. No other prenatal predictor or the polygenic score of CRP in the child explained significant variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. The MPS-CRP at birth prospectively associated with a reduction in global fractional anisotropy over time on mainly a nominal threshold (beta = -0.014, SE = 0.007, p = 0.032), as well as showing nominal associations with structural differences (amygdala [(beta = 0.016, SE = 0.006, p = 0.010], cerebellum [(beta = -0.007, SE = 0.003, p = 0.036]). However, no associations with child psychiatric symptoms were observed. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to lifestyle-related pro-inflammatory factors was the only prenatal predictor that accounted for some of the individual variability in MPS-CRP levels at birth. Further, while the MPS-CRP prospectively associated with white matter alterations over time, no associations were observed at the behavioral level. Thus, the relevance and potential utility of using epigenetic data as a marker of neonatal inflammation in the general population remain unclear. In the future, the use of epigenetic proxies for a wider range of immune markers may lend further insights into the relationship between neonatal inflammation and adverse neurodevelopment within the general pediatric population.

This study investigated DNA methylation in cord blood to identify possible ""at birth"" signatures that may indicate susceptibility to behavioral problems at 18 months of age. Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties. This is the first investigation of cord blood DNA methylation signs of fetal programming of PND on child behavior at 18 months of age and thus calls for independent replications. Copyright © 2022.

Maternal smoking has been linked to adverse health outcomes in newborns but the extent to which it impacts newborn health has not been quantified through an aggregated cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) score. Here, we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. Methods:. We first examined the association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, and smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n=744). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n=347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent White European (n=397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n=504). Results:. Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent association signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p<5 × 10-5). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR = 1.09 [1.07, 1.10], p=5.5 × 10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8 × 10-9) in White Europeans. However, it was not associated with self-reported exposure (p>0.05) among South Asians, likely due to a lack of smoking in this group. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (–0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (–0.043±0.013 kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts. Conclusions:. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birth weight in newborns, in both White European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers.

Methods: We retrieved all patients with documented germline APC mutations and a diagnosis of MBL to examine their outcome, late effects of treatment, and further oncological events. Results: Between 2007 and 2016, we treated six patients, all with a pathogenic APC variant mutation and all with MBL, classic histotype. None had metastatic disease. All patients were in complete remission a median 65 months after treatment with craniospinal irradiation at 23.4 Gy, plus a boost on the posterior fossa/tumor bed up to 54 Gy, followed by cisplatin/carboplatin, lomustine, and vincristine for a maximum of eight courses. Five of six diagnostic revised MRI were suggestive of the WNT molecular subgroup typical aspects. Methylation profile score (in two cases) and copy number variation analysis (chromosome 6 deletion in two cases) performed on four of six retrieved samples confirmed WNT molecular subgroup. Four out of six patients had a positive family history of FAP, while gastrointestinal symptoms prompted its identification in the other two cases. Four patients developed other tumors (desmoid, MELTUMP, melanoma, pancreatoblastoma, thyroid Tir3) from 5 to 7 years after MBL. Discussion: Our data confirm a good prognosis for patients with MBL associated with FAP. Patients’ secondary tumors may or may not be related to their syndrome or treatment, but warrant adequate attention when planning shared guidelines for these patients.","['Massimino, M.', 'Signoroni, S.', 'Boschetti, L.', 'Chiapparini, L.', 'Erbetta, A.', 'Biassoni, V.', 'Schiavello, E.', 'Ferrari, A.', 'Spreafico, F.', 'Terenziani, M.', 'Chiaravalli, S.', 'Puma, N.', 'Bergamaschi, L.', 'Ricci, M.

To distinguish MKHK subtypes and define their characteristics, molecular and extended clinical data on 82 individuals (54 unpublished) with variants affecting CBP (n = 71) or p300 (n = 11) (NP_004371.2 residues 1,705-1,875 and NP_001420.2 residues 1,668-1,833, respectively) were summarized. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were assessed in DNA extracted from whole peripheral blood from 54 individuals. Most variants clustered closely around the zinc-binding residues of two zinc-finger domains (ZZ and TAZ2) and within the first alpha helix of the fourth intrinsically disordered linker (ID4) of CBP/p300. Domain-specific methylation profiles were discerned for the ZZ domain in CBP/p300 (found in nine out of 10 tested individuals) and TAZ2 domain in CBP (in 14 out of 20), while a domain-specific diagnostic episignature was refined for the ID4 domain in CBP/p300 (in 21 out of 21). Phenotypes including intellectual disability of varying degree and distinct physical features were defined for each of the regions. These findings demonstrate existence of at least three MKHK subtypes, which are domain specific (MKHK-ZZ, MKHK-TAZ2, and MKHK-ID4) rather than gene specific (CREBBP/EP300).

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of MPS as a surrogate marker of the biological impact of early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and obstetric complications, childhood adversity and toxic habits), with the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) relapse. 91 participants from a cohort of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with less than five years of evolution were classified as non-relapse (patients who had not experienced a relapse after 3 years of enrollment) or relapse (patients who relapsed during the 3-year follow-up). As inclusion criteria, patients fulfilled Andreasen's criteria of symptomatic remission. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was profiled and fourteen MPS reflecting environmental exposure were constructed including both early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and delivery issues, childhood adversity) and toxic habits. Increased levels of MPS reflecting gestational diabetes (p = 0.009), hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (p = 0.004), pre-eclampsia (p = 0.049), early preterm birth (p = 0.030), childhood adversity abuse (p = 0.021) and all childhood adversity (p = 0.030) were significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse.

Many ""omics"" factors associated with the risk of developing obesity have been identified, including genomic, microbiomic, and epigenomic factors. Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F, and PPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.","['Lariviere, D.', 'Craig, S.

Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

METHODS: We collected patients with duplications encompassing ARID1A and ARID1B duplications. RESULTS: 16 ARID1A and 13 ARID1B duplication cases were included with duplication sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 Mb (1-44 genes) for ARID1A and 0.9 to 10.3 Mb (2-101 genes) for ARID1B. Both groups shared features, with ARID1A patients having more severe intellectual disability, growth delay, and congenital anomalies. DNA methylation analysis showed that ARID1A patients had a specific methylation pattern in blood, which differed from controls and from patients with ARID1A or ARID1B loss-of-function variants. ARID1B patients appeared to have a distinct methylation pattern, similar to ARID1A duplication patients, but further research is needed to validate these results. Five cases with duplications including ARID1A or ARID1B initially annotated as duplications of uncertain significance were evaluated using PhenoScore and DNA methylation reanalysis, resulting in the reclassification of 2 ARID1A and 2 ARID1B duplications as pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that ARID1B duplications manifest a clinical phenotype, and ARID1A duplications have a distinct episignature that overlaps with that of ARID1B duplications, providing further evidence for a distinct and emerging BAFopathy caused by whole-gene duplication rather than haploinsufficiency.

We demonstrate increasing resolution and specificity ranging from protein complex, gene, sub-gene, protein domain, and even single nucleotide-level Mendelian episignatures. We show the power of multiclass modeling to develop highly accurate and disease-specific diagnostic classifiers. This study significantly expands the number and spectrum of disorders with detectable DNA methylation episignatures, improves the clinical diagnostic capabilities through the resolution of unsolved cases and the reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance, and provides further insight into the molecular etiology of Mendelian conditions.","['Levy, Michael A.', 'McConkey, Haley', 'Kerkhof, Jennifer', 'Barat-Houari, Mouna', 'Bargiacchi, Sara', 'Biamino, Elisa', 'Bralo, María Palomares', 'Cappuccio, Gerarda', 'Ciolfi, Andrea', 'Clarke, Angus', 'DuPont, Barbara R.', 'Elting, Mariet W.', 'Faivre, Laurence', 'Fee, Timothy', 'Fletcher, Robin S.', 'Cherik, Florian', 'Foroutan, Aidin', 'Friez, Michael J.', 'Gervasini, Cristina', 'Haghshenas, Sadegheh', 'Hilton, Benjamin A.', 'Jenkins, Zandra', 'Kaur, Simranpreet', 'Lewis, Suzanne', 'Louie, Raymond J.', 'Maitz, Silvia', 'Milani, Donatella', 'Morgan, Angela T.', 'Oegema, Renske', 'Østergaard, Elsebet', 'Pallares, Nathalie Ruiz', 'Piccione, Maria', 'Pizzi, Simone', 'Plomp, Astrid S.', 'Poulton, Cathryn', 'Reilly, Jack', 'Relator, Raissa', 'Rius, Rocio', 'Robertson, Stephen', 'Rooney, Kathleen', 'Rousseau, Justine', 'Santen, Gijs W.

High-throughput sequencing leads to an etiological diagnosis in up to 50% of individuals with heterogeneous neurodevelopmental or malformation disorders. There is a growing interest in additional omics technologies in translational research settings to examine the remaining unsolved cases. Methods: We gathered 30 individuals with malformation syndromes and/or severe neurodevelopmental disorders with negative trio exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization results through a multicenter project. We applied short-read genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation analysis, in that order, as complementary translational research tools for a molecular diagnosis. Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood. Conclusion: Overall, our integrated genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylation analysis solved 10/30 (33.3%) cases and identified a strong candidate gene in 4/30 (13.3%) of the patients with rare neurodevelopmental disorders and negative exome sequencing results.

We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) and copy number variation (CNV) profiling in these tumors (N = 34) using an Illumina EPIC BeadChip to better define the potential use of these tools to confirm diagnosis and predict outcomes. Twenty-seven tumors from 25 patients (age range, 0-10 years), showed molecular confirmation of genetic abnormalities as follows: BCOR internal tandem duplication in 14 PMMTI/UND, 8 CCSK, and 3 HG-NET and YWHAE fusions in 2 PMMTI/UND. The remaining 7 cases lacking informative molecular data were analyzed by immunophenotyping and were included in the study as a training cohort, clearly separated from the main study group. These were 4 PMMTI, 1 HG-NET, and 1 CCSK in which poor RNA preservation precluded the confirmation of BCOR rearrangements and 1 CCSK in which no rearrangements were found. DNAm data were compared with those of brain tumor and/or sarcoma classifier. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were analyzed in the 3 groups. Twenty-two cases of the 24 molecularly confirmed PMMTI/UND and CCSK and 3 of 6 of those with only immunophenotyping were classified within the methylation class ""BCOR-altered sarcoma family"" with optimal calibrated scores. PMMTI/UND and CCSK showed similar methylation profiles, whereas thousands of DMRs and significantly enriched pathways were evident between soft tissue/kidney tumors and HG-NET. The CNV analysis showed an overall flat profile in 19 of the 31 evaluable tumors (8/10 CCSK; 9/18 PMMTI/UND; 2/4 HG-NET). The most frequent CNVs were 1q gain and 9p and 10q loss. Follow-up time data were available for 20 patients: >= 2 CNV significantly correlated with a worse overall survival rate. In conclusion, soft tissue and kidney BCOR sarcomas matched with BCOR-altered sarcoma methylation class, whereas those from the brain matched with the central nervous system tumor classifier HG-NET BCOR, supporting the notion that DNAm profiling is an informative diagnostic tool. CNV alterations were associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

Kdm5c is a histone lysine demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients. Results: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts with previously described epi-signatures. Conclusion: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C gene.","['Schenkel, L.

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n = 749) and 15 (n = 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158, p = 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095, p = 0.06) across all participants. The PM10 findings were driven by the age 15 subset where an interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a -0.024 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.043, -0.005, p = 0.012). Findings were robust to adjustment for PM exposure at ages 1 and 3. In utero PM10-associated DNA methylation differences were identified at age 15 in saliva.

Here, we examined whether exposure to common infections in utero associates with DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns at birth and whether this in turn relates to offspring health outcomes in the general population. METHODS: Using data from 2,367 children from the Dutch population-based Generation R Study, we first performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify differentially methylated sites and regions at birth associated with prenatal infection exposure. We also examined the influence of infection timing by using self-reported cumulative infection scores for each trimester. Second, we sought to develop an aggregate methylation profile score (MPS) based on cord blood DNAm as an epigenetic proxy of prenatal infection exposure and tested whether this MPS prospectively associates with offspring health outcomes, including psychiatric symptoms, BMI, and asthma at ages 13-16 years. Third, we investigated whether prenatal infection exposure associates with offspring epigenetic age acceleration - a marker of biological aging. Across all analysis steps, we tested whether our findings replicate in 864 participants from an independent population-based cohort (ALSPAC, UK). RESULTS: We observed no differentially methylated sites or regions in cord blood in relation to prenatal infection exposure, after multiple testing correction. 33 DNAm sites showed suggestive associations (p < 5e10 - 5; of which one was also nominally associated in ALSPAC), indicating potential links to genes associated with immune, neurodevelopmental, and cardiovascular pathways. While the MPS of prenatal infections associated with maternal reports of infections in the internal hold out sample in the Generation R Study (R2incremental = 0.049), it did not replicate in ALSPAC (R2incremental = 0.001), and it did not prospectively associate with offspring health outcomes in either cohort. Moreover, we observed no association between prenatal exposure to infections and epigenetic age acceleration across cohorts and clocks. CONCLUSION: In contrast to prior studies, which reported DNAm differences in offspring exposed to severe infections in utero, we do not find evidence for associations between self-reported clinically evident common infections during pregnancy and DNAm or epigenetic aging in cord blood within the general pediatric population. Future studies are needed to establish whether associations exist but are too subtle to be statistically meaningful with present sample sizes, whether they replicate in a cohort with a more similar infection score as our discovery cohort, whether they occur in different tissues than cord blood, and whether other biological pathways may be more relevant for mediating the effect of prenatal common infection exposure on downstream offspring health outcomes.

However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. METHODS: Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at birth. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk.

Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences.","['Chen, J. Y.', 'Gatev, E.', 'Everson, T.', 'Conneely, K.

Here, we explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic aspirator-resected tumor tissue to classify otherwise discarded sample material by fast DNA methylation-based analysis using low pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. Methods: Ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens from pediatric patients undergoing brain tumor resection were subjected to low-pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. DNA methylation-based classification using a neural network classifier and copy number variation analysis were performed. Tumor purity was estimated from copy number profiles. Results were compared to microarray (EPIC)-based routine neuropathological histomorphological and molecular evaluation. Results: 19 samples with confirmed neuropathological diagnosis were evaluated. All samples were successfully sequenced and passed quality control for further analysis. DNA and sequencing characteristics from ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens were comparable to routinely processed tumor tissue. Classification of both methods was concordant regarding methylation class in 17/19 (89%) cases. Application of a platform-specific threshold for nanopore-based classification ensured a specificity of 100%, whereas sensitivity was 79%. Copy number variation profiles were generated for all cases and matched EPIC results in 18/19 (95%) samples, even allowing the identification of diagnostically or therapeutically relevant genomic alterations. Conclusion: Methylation-based classification of pediatric CNS tumors based on ultrasonic aspirator-reduced and otherwise discarded tissue is feasible using time- and cost-efficient nanopore sequencing.","['Simon, M.', 'Kuschel, L.

A major differential diagnosis for poorly differentiated tumors in the cerebellum in children is medulloblastoma. In this study, we described the histological and molecular features of a series of five pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum. They actually showed histological and immunohistochemical features that overlapped with those of medulloblastomas and achieved high scores in NanoString-based medulloblastoma diagnostic assay. Methylation profiling demonstrated these tumors were heterogeneous epigenetically, clustering to GBM_MID, DMG_K27, and GBM_RTKIII methylation classes. MYCN amplification was present in one case, and PDGFRA amplification in another two cases. Interestingly, target sequencing showed that all tumors carried TP53 mutations. Our results highlight that pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum can mimic medulloblastomas at histological and transcriptomic levels. Our report adds to the rare number of cases in the literature of cerebellar HGGs in children.

This condition is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous. Deletions involving two non-overlapping regions, known as the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are sufficient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorphisms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region. Here, we used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to define a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that overlap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. The clinical profile of this disease includes developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention deficit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrow palate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especially in females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co-expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsufficiency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affected females, providing further evidence of a specific contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome-specific episignature that classifies syndromic traits. We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric to the previously established 1p36 critical regions.

It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N = 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency.","['Tieskens, J.

Understanding the impact of parenting interventions on biological markers associated with these risks is crucial for mitigating long-term health disparities. Objective: To examine the effect of 20 weeks of an internet-based parent-child interaction training (iPCIT) program on biomarkers associated with aging and chronic inflammation among preschoolers with developmental delay at 12-month follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: An observational secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 17, 2016, to December 15, 2020, to assess changes in salivary DNA methylation (DNAm)-derived biomarkers following iPCIT intervention. Participants were recruited from 3 Part C early intervention sites in a large southeastern US city. Eligible participants included children recruited within 3 months of their third birthday who had a Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Problems T score greater than 60 and provided saliva in at least 1 study wave. Data analysis was conducted May 2023 to April 2024. Intervention: Participants received either iPCIT (a telehealth therapeutic intervention focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship and addressing behavioral challenges in young children) or referrals as usual. Main Outcomes and Measures: DNAm at the 12-month follow-up was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC Bead Chip Assay to derive biomarkers DunedinPACE, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analyses were intent-to-treat and used path analysis. Results: A total of 71 children (mean [SD] age, 36.27 [0.61] months 51 male [71.8%] and 20 female [28.2%]) were analyzed, of whom 34 received iPCIT and 37 received referrals as usual. The iPCIT group had a slower pace of aging (beta = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.50; P = .03) and less DNAm-derived CRP (beta = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.49; P = .01) relative to the control condition at the 12-month follow-up. These associations remained significant after accounting for baseline DNAm score, child demographics, and symptom severity, and were independent of predicted buccal epithelial cell proportion for both DunedinPACE and CRP. There was no association with DNAm-derived IL-6 (beta = 0.14; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.36; P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a parenting intervention, iPCIT, the association of intervention with decreased molecular markers of inflammation and biological aging suggests their potential to modify aspects of the biological embedding of stress. Understanding the systemic biological impact of such interventions offers insights into addressing health disparities and promoting resilience among vulnerable populations.

Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.","['Reed, Z. E.', 'Suderman, M. J.', 'Relton, C.

It is caused by pathogenic variants in the PHIP gene that encodes for the Pleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein, which is part of an epigenetic modifier protein complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHIP haploinsufficiency may impact genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the DNAm profiles of affected individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic PHIP variants with Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays and report a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature biomarker for Chung-Jansen syndrome. In addition, we observed similarities between the methylation profile of Chung-Jansen syndrome and that of functionally related and clinically partially overlapping genetic disorders, White-Kernohan syndrome (caused by variants in DDB1 gene) and Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (caused by variants in PHF6 gene). Based on these observations we also proceeded to develop a common episignature biomarker for these disorders. These newly defined episignatures can be used as part of a multiclass episignature classifier for screening of affected individuals with rare disorders and interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance, and provide further insights into the common molecular pathophysiology of the clinically-related Chung-Jansen, Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann and White-Kernohan syndromes.

Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases.

Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype–phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26–28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.","['Dingemans, A.

Archival files from three pediatric institutions were queried for unusual cases of pediatric (<=21 years) CNS EWSR1-rearranged tumors confirmed by at least one molecular technique. Extra-axial tumors and cases with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1-ETS family fusions) were excluded. Additional studies, including anchored multiplex-PCR with next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, were performed as needed to determine fusion partner status and brain tumor methylation class, respectively. Five cases (median 17 years) were identified (M:F of 3:2). Location was parenchymal (n = 3) and undetermined (n = 2) with topographic distributions including posterior fossa (n = 1), frontal (n = 1), temporal (n = 1), parietal (n = 1) and occipital (n = 1) lobes. Final designation with fusion findings included desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWSR1-WT1; n = 1) and tumors of uncertain histogenesis (EWSR1-CREM, n = 1; EWSR1-CREB1, n = 1; EWSR1-PLAGL1, n = 1; and EWSR1-PATZ1, n = 1). Tumors showed a wide spectrum of morphology and biologic behavior. For EWSR1-CREM, EWSR1-PLAGL1 and EWSR1-PATZ1 tumors, no significant methylation scores were reached in the known brain tumor classes. Available outcome (4/5) was reported as favorable (n = 2) and unfavorable (n = 2) with a median follow-up of 30 months. In conclusion, we describe five primary EWSR1-non-ETS fused CNS tumors exhibiting morphologic and biologic heterogeneity and we highlight the clinical importance of determining specific fusion partners to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment and monitoring. Larger prospective clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of histotypes, anatomical location, fusion partners, breakpoints and methylation profiles in patients with these rare tumors.

However, it remains poorly understood whether variants reoccurring at specific sites of lysine-specific methlytransferase-2B (KMT2B) can drive intra- and interfamilial clinical heterogeneity. Our goal was to ascertain independent families with variants affecting residue Arg2565 of KMT2B. METHODS: Whole-exome/genome sequencing, multi-site recruitment, genotype-phenotype correlations, and DNA methylation episignature analysis were performed. RESULTS: We report four individuals from two families harboring the variant c.7693C > G, p.Arg2565Gly. In an additional patient, a de-novo c.7693C > T, p.Arg2565Cys variant was identified. The observed phenotypic spectrum ranged from childhood-onset dystonia (N = 2) over unspecific intellectual disability syndromes (N = 2) to undiagnosed behavioral symptoms in adulthood (N = 1). Samples bearing p.Arg2565Gly had a KMT2B-typical episignature, although the effect on methylation was less pronounced than in carriers of loss-of-function KMT2B variants. CONCLUSIONS: We established the existence of a KMT2B missense-mutation hotspot associated with varying degrees of disease severity and expression, providing information for patient counseling and elucidation of pathomechanisms.
